# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, implemented as Python Jupyter Notebooks.

## About Advent of Code

*https://adventofcode.com/* is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming challenge is released, and participants can solve the problems in any programming language of their choice.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the corresponding day's challenge.

```
